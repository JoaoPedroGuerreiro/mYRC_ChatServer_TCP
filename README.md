# mYRC_ChatServer_TCP


I built a server and client using a TCP connection in Java, something I learned during my bootcamp. It started as a simple chat application running locally from the command line, where the server listens for connections and the client connects using sockets. As I keep learning more about networking and Java, Iâ€™m now planning to add more features, starting with a GUI.
